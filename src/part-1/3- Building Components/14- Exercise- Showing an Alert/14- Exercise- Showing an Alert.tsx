/*
ðŸ’¡ Explanation and Context of Event Handlers and State Management:

In this component, the state (`alertVisible`) is handled entirely within the parent component context (`Dismiss`), clearly satisfying the React best practice of "lifting state up."

- State (`alertVisible`) lives in the parent component (`Dismiss`).
- The parent component passes down event handler functions (`onClick`, `onClose`) to the child components (`Button`, `Alert`) as props.
- When an event triggers (`onClick` in Button or `onClose` in Alert), the child component executes the function received as a prop.
- Importantly, the function invoked is actually defined in the parent context, meaning the state update or any logic inside these functions still happens within the parent component.
- Passing these functions as props to child components provides only **references** (similar to pointers) to the original event-handler functions located in the parent component. The child component itself doesnâ€™t process or own the actual stateâ€”it just triggers the function.

ðŸ”µ Visualization of how state and handlers are managed here:

ðŸ”µ Dismiss Component (Parent)
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ defines state (`alertVisible`)
â”‚â”€â”€ provides event handlers (`setAlertVisible`) â”€â”€> passed via props to children
â”‚
â”œâ”€ ðŸ”´ Button Component (Child): Receives `onClick` prop (reference to parent's event handler)
â”‚       â”‚â”€â”€ Invokes parent's `onClick` handler to update parent's state (`alertVisible` to true)
â”‚
â””â”€ ðŸŸ¢ Alert Component (Child): Receives `onClose` prop (reference to parent's event handler)
        â”‚â”€â”€ Invokes parent's `onClose` handler to update parent's state (`alertVisible` to false)

âœ… Benefits of this approach (lifting state):
    âœ… Single source of truth (state in one place: easier debug and predictability).
    âœ… Greater reusability and clearer separation of concerns for child components.
    âœ… Adheres to React principles of unidirectional data flow from parent to child.
